Google Docs is a free Web-based application in which documents and spreadsheets can be created, edited and stored online. 
Files can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection and a full-featured Web browser. 
Google Docs is a part of a comprehensive package of online applications offered by and associated with Google.
Users of Google Docs can import, create, edit and update documents and spreadsheets in various fonts and file formats, combining text with formulas, lists, tables and images. Google Docs is compatible with most presentation software and word processor applications. Work can be published as a Web page or as a print-ready manuscript. Users can control who sees their work. Google Docs is ideal for publishing within an enterprise, maintaining blogs or composing work for viewing by the general public.
Google Docs lends itself to collaborative projects in which multiple authors work together in real time from geographically diverse locations.
All participants can see who made specific document changes and when those alterations were done.
Because documents are stored online and can also be stored on users' computers, there is no risk of total data loss as a result of a localized catastrophe. 
However, the Internet-based nature of Google Docs has given rise to concerns among some authors that their work may not be private or secure.
